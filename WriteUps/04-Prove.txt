After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Provide a link to your myDb.sql file at GitHub (the file that contains all the SQL commands needed to create your database).
https://github.com/peterfoxflick/cs313-php/blob/master/db/myDb.sql

2. Describe something from your database that you think came together very nicely.
I think the content and courses tie together in an elegant way.

3. Describe something from your database that you think could be improved or extended in the future.
I think the completion table is lacking, and will have to be tested as the program develops.

4. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
I learned that relational database use ids to coordinate relations. This is the "coolest" when you have a many-to-many relation that has ids going in both directions in a third table.

5. Briefly describe two principles of good database design.
  1. Save your commands used to build the database. This allows you to alter them or look back at them when needed.
  2. Reduce redundant data when possibles. Not only will this help you save space, but it also reduces complexity when having to update a single data point.

6. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
A - Some attempt was made
B - Developing, but significantly deficient
C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
D - Meets requirements
E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

*E*

7. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
Not only does my database work, it also has some data inserted into it. Furthermore, the database shows relations between two tables, and not just a series of one-to-one relations.
