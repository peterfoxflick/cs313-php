After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application:
https://mysterious-sands-95461.herokuapp.com/LMS/index.php

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/peterfoxflick/cs313-php

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. Include any special instructions about how to login and/or use your application.
Add page, course, and view edit page.

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
Edit page, edit course order.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
I learned that you can change the post name by changing the name of the input, not the id.


6. What is a benefit of having a foreign key constraint?
It makes cross-listing between tables easier and it checks current status of the id in the foreign table. This allows you to add the constraint knowing that the id is a valid id as both tables change.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
A - Some attempt was made
B - Developing, but significantly deficient
C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
D - Meets requirements
E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

*E*

The add functions work and look clean. 


8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
